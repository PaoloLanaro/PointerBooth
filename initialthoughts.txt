Type Test Cheat
+ Use OpenCV to get the user's screen.
+ Break it up into some region where there is text to be parsed.
 - Maybe GUI to allow for customization of text location.
     (e.g. snipping tool or similar selection tool? top left, bottom right, output region)
 - Otherwise, hardcoded values
+ Parse the text with tesseract-ocr
+ Write text to website / application
 - Find out some way to write the characters to application simulating human typing.
    (cause I don't think I can just write out full strings)

ASL Translator
+ Get user hand symbols and gestures using OpenCV
+ Make some sort of neural net to figure out what it means in english
 - No idea how to do any of this so idk...



New idea:
Beginnings of ASL / hand gesture reader.
+ Find how many fingers someone if holding up.
 - 1-5 fingers "up" detection
+ OpenCV
